Introduction
============

The API contains data from different sources. We don't attempt to normalize and standardize all data, we simply offer each data source 'as is' in their own index. The API does contain a combined index which allows for searching through the basics of each data source, i.e. the title, description, etc. The API follows a common design (REST) and document format (JSON), known by many developers.

Features
--------

* Data of different NPO/omroep data sources is made searchable in a uniform manner.
* All original data is kept and remains accessible in it's original form.
* When possible, references to the original item's location (in the form of URLs) are included.
* A simple REST API to easily search, filter and retrieve items.
